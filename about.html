    <hr>

    <p>Face it: you're a workaholic. Maybe not always consciously, but more often than not, you look up at the end of that
        "last thing" you were just finishing up, and notice you're the only one <em>still</em> in the office! Damn, not again!
        That's the <em>third</em> time this week! Oh well, you think to yourself, no distractions ; I can finish this <em>real</em>
        last thing before I go home and...DINNER! You haven't had dinner!</p>
    
    <p>This is where <em>we</em> step in. No more fast, greasy, or generally unhealthy late-night entrees that conspire with your
        workaholic ways to cause that inevitable heart attack! We're not judging, just sayin'...</p>

    <p>Let our world-class and trained culinary chefs provide thoughtful and well-balanced meals for you so you can finally, 
        <em>finally</em> get rid of that "last thing" that's taking precedence right now!</p>

    <p>Currently, we're only able to offer our services to the greater D.C. area. Please check back periodically as we add new cities! </p>
